I am a first-year PhD student at [department of computer science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science), [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), supervised by [Wei-Kai Lin](https://weikailin.github.io/). I received my Master degree at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), majoring in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science ([MFoCS](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science)) in 2023. Before coming Oxford, I obtained my bachelor's degree at University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/)), majoring in Mathematics.

I have a broad interest in Cryptography and theoretical computer science.
