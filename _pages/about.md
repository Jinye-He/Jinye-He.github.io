I am a research assistant at [department of computer science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), supervised by [Jiaheng Zhang](https://zjhzjh123.github.io/). I received my Master degree at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), majoring in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science ([MFoCS](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science)) in 2023. Before coming Oxford, I obtained my bachelor's degree at University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/)), majoring in Mathematics.

I have a broad interest in Cryptography, especially Zero-Knowledge.
