When I was an undergraduate student, I learned Combinatorics and was surprised by the grace of this branch of mathematics. I conducted my undergraduate research about extending Baranyai's Theorem, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Hao Huang](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/huanghao/) and [Prof. Jie Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jiema/).

During my studying time at Oxford, I was introduced to Cryptography and realized that I wished to do something more relevant to practical applications. Now I'm pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in maths at Oxford and looking for a PhD position.
