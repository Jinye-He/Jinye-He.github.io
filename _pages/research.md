When I was an undergraduate student, I learned Combinatorics and was surprised by the grace of this branch of mathematics. I conducted my undergraduate research about extending Baranyai's Theorem, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Hao Huang](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/huanghao/) and [Prof. Jie Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jiema/).    

**[An Extension Baranyai's Theorem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00277.pdf)**  

- Baranyai's Theorem states that a complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices is $1$-factorable if and only if $k\mid n$. This project try to extend this theorem into non-uniform settings. We finally determined all n, k, such that the family $K_n^{\le k}$ consisting of subsets of $[n]$ of size up to k is 1-factorable, and thus extend Baranyai’s Theorem to the non-uniform setting.

During my studying time at Oxford, I was introduced to Cryptography and realized that I wished to do something more relevant to practical applications. Now I'm pursuing my master’s degree in maths at Oxford and looking for a PhD position.
