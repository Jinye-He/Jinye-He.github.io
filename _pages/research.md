When I was an undergraduate student, I learned Combinatorics and was surprised by the grace of this branch of mathematics. I conducted my undergraduate research about extending Baranyai's Theorem, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Hao Huang](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/huanghao/) and [Prof. Jie Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jiema/).    

**[An Extension Baranyai's Theorem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00277.pdf)**  

- Baranyai's Theorem states that a complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices is $1$-factorable if and only if $k\mid n$. This project try to extend this theorem into non-uniform settings. We finally determined all n, k, such that the family $K_n^{\le k}$ consisting of subsets of $[n]$ of size up to k is 1-factorable, and thus extend Baranyaiâ€™s Theorem to the non-uniform setting.

As my master's dissertation, I paid my attention on the breakthrough of Kahn-Kalai Conjecture by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham. My supervisor is Prof. Paul Balister.  

**[A survey of Kahn-Kalai Conjecture](https://github.com/Jinye-He/Jinye-He.github.io/blob/master/assets/dissertation.pdf)**

- Park and Pham successfully proved the renowned Kahn-Kalai conjecture, offering an elegant upper bound for thresholds which is a core problem in random discrete structures. This survey focuses on the Kahn-Kalai conjecture, offering many examples to make the conjecture more motivated and various applications to vividly illustrate the profound significance of this conjecture.

During my studying time at Oxford, I took some courses in Number Theory and was introduced to Cryptography. I took a course of Cryptography and wrote a [course project about blind signature](https://github.com/Jinye-He/Jinye-He.github.io/blob/master/assets/courseproject.pdf). I was attracted by Cryptography since it combines both real-world applications and an elegant mathematical theoretical foundation. Now, I am begining my new journey of research in Cryptography under the guidance of [Prof. Jiaheng Zhang](https://zjhzjh123.github.io/).
